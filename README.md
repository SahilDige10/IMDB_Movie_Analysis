## 🔑 Key Insights
1.  **The Runtime Sweet Spot:** The ideal runtime for a top-rated movie is **100-130 minutes**.
2.  **Volume vs. Value:** While **Drama** is the most common genre, **Adventure & Animation** yield the highest average ROI.
3.  **The "Money Myth":** There is no strong linear correlation between High Budget and High Rating.
4.  **Strategic Formula:** The highest probability of commercial success comes from **Family-Friendly (U/UA)**, **Adventure** movies released in the modern era.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
